  description: While working as an independent web developer I developed websites for small businesses.  In all cases I utilized a Linux web server with SSH access.  The most challenging and rewarding project I've done on a Linux server was deploying a bamboo server to an AWS VM running ubuntu.  The purpose of this was to create an environment that I could create POCs and quickly deploy them via Git.
