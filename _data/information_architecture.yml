- title: SharePoint
  description: This plan was drafted with the assistance of several business owners to faciliate a strategy for maintaining their content on the SharePoint site.  The SharePoint would go on to be accessed by several hundreds of users including instructional designers, software developers, and managers.  The unique challenge here was creating a content strategy that all of the stakeholders agreed upon; this led to several whiteboarding sessions and many subsequent drafts.

- title: Online Catalog
  description: Changing formats for an existing product offered many challenges.  By taking a print-based catalog and placing it online the goal was to offer additional access to customers.  Additional challenges had to be answered for the mobile format where it was decided upon by stakeholders to downsize the amount of information offered in the web format.
