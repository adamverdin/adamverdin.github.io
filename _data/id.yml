- title: Instructional Guide
  description: This guide was written with the assistance of a software engineer SME.  The training was identified as ILT in the Front-end analysis.  After being assigned to this project I met with the SME on numerous occassions to analyze learning objectives, topics, and to identify learners.  One of the unique challenges of this project was creating a performanced base instructional guide for a programming language I was not familiar with.
