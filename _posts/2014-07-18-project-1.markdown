description: i-Learn is a learning technology designed to deliver training content through a Healthcare Training Software.  By leverage APIs and working with another software development team we were able to stand up a platform that did not require users to go to a Learning Management System.  Instead they could click on a button and launch the application.  My contributions in the project were UI/UX design, API development, and as Product owner.
